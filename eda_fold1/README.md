# Overview
* Conduct data cleaning/exploratory data Analysis(EDA) on Wesleyan Media Project (WMP) tracking data. 
* There are largerly two parts to this section (each section has its own data cleaning in the r code): 
1) Using the tracking data to create plots for each level of races by each year. 
2) Creating a descriptive statistics chart 


* Number 1 was not successful as there were hundreds of plots and hard to interpret
* In lieu of plots, we create a descriptive statistics chart and make a summary table that gives a bird's-eye-view of the data.
