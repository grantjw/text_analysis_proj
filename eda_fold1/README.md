# Overview
* Conduct data cleaning/exploratory data Analysis(EDA) on Wesleyan Media Project (WMP) tracking data. 
* There are largerly two parts to this section (each section has its own data cleaning in the r code): 
1) Using the tracking data to create plots for each level of races by each year. Refer to "plots" for further detail.
2) Creating a [descriptive statistics chart](https://github.com/grantjw/text_analysis_proj2/blob/main/eda_fold1/descriptive_stat/Descriptive%20Stat.xlsx) for each level of races and outputting a summary table (shown below) for the entire data. Refer to "descriptive_stat" for further detail. 
 

* Number 1 needed hundreds of graphs and therefore hard to interpret. The process is left incomplete as it had no value. 
* In lieu of plots, we create a descriptive statistics chart and make a summary table that gives a bird's-eye-view of the data.
